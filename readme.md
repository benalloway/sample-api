<h1>Simple API: for MAXX Learning and Leveling.</h1>

Built in Python using Flask and CSV, I am building an API that allows CRUD requests on a products database. I am using CSV, and a csv file as the database to learn how to manipulate data as needed. 

The Application has a front end interface built in Jinja 2 that allows use to interact with the data. The data is read and then stored into a Python Dictionary for each request, and then written back into CSV once request has been completed.
